# Tekever Challenge

### Description

Hello my name is Joao Moura and this is my Tekever Challenge.\
To approach this challenge I decided to use the "new" minimal API created by
the Microsoft. Never used but had a lot of fun learning and trying out this method of 
building APIs. Used Sqlite for the database to easy create a local Db and everyone use.
I don't have a lot of experience in .NET 6/7 or building APIs so I was learning
as I was doing. Missing some features and I added some Authorization method for the headers
but didn't quite catch how to document in the swagger but it can be uncommented and used in Postman and insert in the header.
To finish I used integration tests, didn't use unit because with the tests I made I covered almost all the code I wrote.

### How to use

To start the api, simply go to the folder TvShowApi.Publish 
and double click in the TvShowAPI.exec file.
Then open a browser and insert the webpage http://localhost:5000/Swagger/index.html
to use the API. \
Have fun!! I know I did :).
